    /// --- Day 2: 1202 Program Alarm ---
    /// On the way to your gravity assist around the Moon, your ship computer beeps 
    /// angrily about a "1202 program alarm". On the radio, an Elf is already explaining 
    /// how to handle the situation: "Don't worry, that's perfectly norma--"
    /// The ship computer bursts into flames.
    /// 
    /// You notify the Elves that the computer's magic smoke seems to have escaped. 
    /// "That computer ran Intcode programs like the gravity assist program it was 
    /// working on; surely there are enough spare parts up there to build a new Intcode computer!"
    /// 
    /// An Intcode program is a list of integers separated by commas (like 1,0,0,3,99). 
    /// To run one, start by looking at the first integer(called position 0). Here, you will 
    /// find an opcode - either 1, 2, or 99.
    /// The opcode indicates what to do; for example, 
    /// 99 means that the program is finished and should immediately halt.
    /// Encountering an unknown opcode means something went wrong.
    /// 
    /// Opcode 1 adds together numbers read from two positions and stores the result in a third position.
    /// The three integers immediately after the opcode tell you these three positions - 
    /// the first two indicate the positions from which you should read the input values, 
    /// and the third indicates the position at which the output should be stored.
    /// For example, if your Intcode computer encounters 1,10,20,30, it should read the values 
    /// at positions 10 and 20, add those values, and then overwrite the value at position 30 
    /// with their sum.
    /// 
    /// Opcode 2 works exactly like opcode 1, except it multiplies the two inputs instead 
    /// of adding them. Again, the three integers after the opcode indicate where the inputs 
    /// and outputs are, not their values.
    /// 
    /// Once you're done processing an opcode, move to the next one by stepping forward 4 positions.
    /// For example, suppose you have the following program:
    /// 1,9,10,3,2,3,11,0,99,30,40,50
    /// 
    /// For the purposes of illustration, here is the same program split into multiple lines:
    /// 1,9,10,3,
    /// 2,3,11,0,
    /// 99,
    /// 30,40,50
    /// The first four integers, 1,9,10,3, are at positions 0, 1, 2, and 3. Together, 
    /// they represent the first opcode (1, addition), the positions of the two inputs(9 and 10),
    /// and the position of the output(3). To handle this opcode, you first need to get the values 
    /// at the input positions: position 9 contains 30, and position 10 contains 40.
    /// Add these numbers together to get 70. Then, store this value at the output position;
    /// here, the output position (3) is at position 3, so it overwrites itself.
    /// Afterward, the program looks like this:
    /// 1,9,10,70,
    /// 2,3,11,0,
    /// 99,
    /// 30,40,50
    /// Step forward 4 positions to reach the next opcode, 2. This opcode works just like the previous, 
    /// but it multiplies instead of adding. The inputs are at positions 3 and 11; 
    /// these positions contain 70 and 50 respectively. Multiplying these produces 3500; 
    /// this is stored at position 0:
    /// 3500,9,10,70,
    /// 2,3,11,0,
    /// 99,
    /// 30,40,50
    /// Stepping forward 4 more positions arrives at opcode 99, halting the program.
    /// 
    /// Here are the initial and final states of a few more small programs:
    /// 1,0,0,0,99 becomes 2,0,0,0,99 (1 + 1 = 2).
    /// 2,3,0,3,99 becomes 2,3,0,6,99 (3 * 2 = 6).
    /// 2,4,4,5,99,0 becomes 2,4,4,5,99,9801 (99 * 99 = 9801).
    /// 1,1,1,4,99,5,6,0,99 becomes 30,1,1,4,2,5,6,0,99.
    /// 
    /// Once you have a working computer, the first step is to restore the gravity assist 
    /// program (your puzzle input) to the "1202 program alarm" state it had just before 
    /// the last computer caught fire.
    /// To do this, before running the program, replace position 1 with the value 12 and 
    /// replace position 2 with the value 2.
    /// What value is left at position 0 after the program halts?
